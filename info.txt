*** Dep is a dependency management tool for Go
https://golang.github.io/dep/

When using 3rd party libraries need to use Dep to control vendor files for versioning capabilities, install Dep with:
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh

https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/introduction.html

on Windows:
https://github.com/golang/dep/releases
copy the binary to the Go Bin directory (e.g. c:\dev\src\Go\bin) and rename to "dep.exe"

from in Go project src directory (e.g. c:\dev\src\go\src\local\language) and from command prompt run:
> dep init
PS> & "$env:GOPATH\bin\dep" init

creates Gopkg.toml and Gopkg.lock and vendor/

* NOTE: if new third party libraries are added or updated then use:
> dep ensure
PS> & "$env:GOPATH\bin\dep" ensure
* to update vendor and package lock information
